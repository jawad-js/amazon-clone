# Amazon Clone Landing Page

This project is a front-end implementation of an Amazon-inspired landing page. It's built with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript to provide a responsive layout and a mobile navigation toggle.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS media queries.
* **Amazon-like Navigation:** Includes a navigation bar with a logo, address display, search bar, language selection, sign-in/account links, and cart information.
* **Mobile Menu Toggle:** A toggle button (bars icon) appears on smaller screens to show or hide the navigation panel.
* **Hero Section:** A prominent section at the top of the page, featuring a rotating image banner and a message.
* **Product Showcase:** Displays product categories in organized boxes within a grid layout.
* **Footer:** Includes links to various Amazon-related sections and copyright/creator information.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure of the webpage (`index.html`).
* **CSS:** For styling and layout, including responsive design (`style.css`).
* **JavaScript:** For handling the mobile menu toggle functionality (`script.js`).
* **Font Awesome:** For icons.

## Files Included

* `index.html`: The main HTML file.
* `style.css`:  The CSS stylesheet.
* `script.js`:  The JavaScript file for the mobile menu toggle.
* `images/`:  Directory containing images used in the page.
* `layout_images/`: Directory containing layout images.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]  # Replace with your repository URL
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd amazon-clone
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to view the landing page.

## Key JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

* The `script.js` file handles the mobile menu toggle.  It selects the toggle button (`mobile-menu-toggle`) and the navigation panel (`panel`).  It adds an event listener to the toggle button to show/hide the panel when clicked. It also hides the panel by default on mobile view and shows it on desktop view.

## How to Commit Changes to README.md (or any file)

1.  **Make your changes:** Use a text editor to open `README.md` and modify it as needed. Save the file.

2.  **Check the status:** Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory (`amazon-clone`), and type:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    This will show you the files that have been modified.  You should see `README.md` (or any other changed file) listed.

3.  **Stage the changes:** Tell Git which changes you want to include in your commit:
    ```bash
    git add README.md   # Or git add . to add all changed files
    ```

4.  **Commit the changes:** Create a commit with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Update README: Added setup instructions and project details"
    ```
    Replace `"Update README: Added setup instructions and project details"` with a message that accurately describes your changes.

5.  **Push the changes (if you're using a remote repository like GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git push origin main  # Or git push origin master, depending on your main branch name
    ```
    This will upload your local commit to the remote repository.
